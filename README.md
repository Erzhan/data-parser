Useful terms:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of extracting entities, such as proper name (person, location and organization), time (date and time), and numerical values (currency and percentage), from the source text, and mapping them into predefined categories, such as person, organization, location name or “none-of-the-above”.
- Geoparsing/Geocoding the process of recognizing geographic context is referred to as geoparsing. Geoparsing can be considered as a part of Named Entity task, but it extracts more variety of geographic entities, such as street, city, phone numbers, ZIP/postal codes, URL, geographic contexts derived from content or hyperlinks, and network routing information.
